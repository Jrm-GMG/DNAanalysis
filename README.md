Analysis of an American genetic markers dataset

## Technologies
R

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- R (version 4.1.2 tested)

## Approach
The goal is to use genetic markers to predict the geographical origin of an individual. 
Individuals are Indians from America. I propose to build predictive linear models to predict latitude and longitude of an individual from its genetic markers. 
Because the number of markers is larger than the number of samples, a PCA will be used in order to reduce the dimension.
